# uvb-svga-bgi-english

This repository is a fork of the original [SVGABGI](https://github.com/javiergutierrezchamorro/SVGABGI) driver project with an English-language version of source code comments to help native English speakers to better understand the codebase.
 
## Important Note

*All translations were performed using machine translation (i.e., AI) in August 2025.* As such, they will not be perfect, may differ from the original German text, and may not be particularly accurate.

Further, even though the instructions given to the AI models were to not alter the code other than the comments (and strings, in the [svgademo.c](svgademo/svgademo.c) file), *the AI models used to do the translation may have modified the source code itself!* The code here has *not* been verified against the original source code, or tested in any way.

Therefore, **IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO REBUILD THIS PROJECT FROM THIS VERSION OF THE SOURCE CODE.** Use this repository for reference purposes only. The original source code is available in the [SVGABGI](https://github.com/javiergutierrezchamorro/SVGABGI) repository.

When in doubt, refer to the original source code itself as the most authoritative reference, then to the original German comments, then to these translated comments and this source code.
