Version                 Changes

2.00A   01.07.1991      First version, expandable and supporting multiple cards.

2.00B   09.07.1991      GRAPH.RES (resource file for EditPal) now contains only
                        the actually required driver.

2.00C   10.07.1991      Completely new version of BGIBench, this time without
                        using MTK.

2.10A   12.07.1991      Support for the Trident-8900 chipset by SVGA.BGI
                        (8800 is not tested).

2.11A   18.07.1991      Palette initialization after driver initialization
                        handled differently. New demo program PCXView.
                        The following were removed from the distribution in
                        favor of PCXView and some PCX images:
                          - BGIDemo
                          - The BGI Drivers Toolkit (available on request
                            from me. Don't forget return postage!).
                          - The Borland font editor.

2.11B   20.07.1991      Small bug removed from PCXVIEW (a directory was
                        specified in InitGraph - worked great for me, but
                        probably for no one else). EDITPAL expanded to support
                        all video modes.
                        Mouse control in IServer changed, so the mouse cursor
                        should now be compatible with all mouse drivers.

2.20A   22.08.1991      Fast ellipse routines and fill routines for FillEllipse
                        added. As compensation, the specialized circle routine
                        was removed, so circles are now drawn a few percent
                        slower.
                        Changed erase routine.
                        Various fonts removed from GRAPH.RES to save space.
                        Small changes in: BGIBench, EditPal.

2.30A   05.09.1991      Support for Video7 cards. Some minor code changes for
                        clarity and optimization.
                        Utility programs adapted as necessary to support new
                        modes.

2.30B   01.10.1991      EditPal recompiled due to changes in the underlying
                        multitasking kernel. No changes to EditPal itself.

3.00A   28.11.1991      Support for more cards, autodetect mode.
                        Driver's table structures completely changed.
                        Only one PutPixel/GetPixel function.
                        Utility programs adapted.

3.01A   04.01.1992      Fixed bug in the driver's GetPixByte function.
                        Caused GetImageSize to return a value four times too
                        large, which (when using GetImageSize) limited the
                        size of image sections to 16 KB of image data. Now
                        full 64 KB are possible. No other changes.

3.01B   10.03.1992      Various changes to text files; EditPal temporarily
                        removed; new module PixFont.

3.10A   23.07.1992      Minor changes. Support for VESA cards.
                        Support for Oak card. 286 and 386 version.
                        New program FontDemo, improved version of PixFont,
                        more pixel fonts. No more verbose names.
                        FillPoly in assembler. Vector fonts removed from
                        distribution.

3.10B   07.09.1992      New program SVGADEMO. New version of PList.
                        Minor changes to README.TXT.

3.10C   26.10.1992      New example programs for resource file. Changes to
                        text files.

3.11A   30.11.1992      Since version 3.20 is still delayed, release of V 3.11
                        as a bugfix version.
                        - For clip windows exactly the height or width of a
                          character, OutText did not output any text.
                        - Bug in Oak card detection.
                        - Fixed a bug in the 286 version.
                        - Before autodetect, mode 3 (text 80x25) is first
                          enabled to correctly initialize the card (detection
                          of PVGA chips).
                        - For PatBar, with fill pattern = SolidFill, width = 1,
                          and odd X coordinate, only the top pixel was drawn.

3.20A   09.02.1993      FloodFill implemented. Page switching documented and
                        extended.

3.21A   16.05.1993      FillPoly "repaired". Version 7.0 of TP puts a flag in
                        the highest bit of the counter, which must be cleared
                        before using the counter. Unfortunately, the interface
                        to FillPoly is completely incorrectly documented, so I
                        always have to rely on my own investigations here.
                        PutImage now has a new mode TransPut (not my idea!),
                        where all pixels with color 0 are not drawn.
                        Version query removed from the source of PCXView.
                        Version of PixFont for C included.

3.21B   23.05.1993      Change to README. Beta version of the driver for BP7
                        (DPMI) included. New file README.BP7

3.21C   27.10.1993      DPMI driver declared as NON-Beta, release of the free
                        version.

3.21D   29.10.1993      Various remnants from the commercial version removed
                        from SVGA.TEX.

3.33A   30.11.1993      New version of the DPMI driver. Texts revised again.

3.33B   14.01.1994      SVGA.TEX translated to ASCII and slightly expanded.
                        README.TXT adapted. Most of the PCX images removed,
                        since the driver is now almost exclusively distributed
                        by phone (no longer by disk), and (unfortunately)
                        every KB counts...

3.40A   21.08.1994      "S3-Release" :-) S3 detection and mode switching
                        improved. New mode 1280*1024 for S3 cards.
                        Use of the S3 Graphics Engine for various functions.
                        Page switching had to be completely rewritten.
                        Minor 486 optimizations in the 386 version.
                        Text files expanded and adapted.
                        NOTE: Mode numbers have changed.
                        All PCX images deleted.

3.50A   09.01.1995      Change to FillPoly: The graphics kernel changes the
                        algorithm for filled circles when it detects that the
                        loaded driver directly supports FillPoly, with the
                        effect that small circles are no longer round.
                        The driver was adapted to circumvent this behavior of
                        the graphics kernel.
                        Driver adapted to version 1.2 of the VESA standard,
                        with newer VESA drivers multiple screen pages are
                        possible.
                        New mode 1024*768 ATI Wonder (thanks to Thomas Seidel,
                        seidel@ipe.et.uni-magdeburg.de), which unfortunately
                        changed some of the card-specific mode numbers.

3.51A   03.05.1995      Bug removed from PCXView (HRes and VRes were
                        misinterpreted). Changes to SVGA.DOC, PIXFONT.DOC and
                        CHANGES.
                        Change to SVGA.BGI: The driver no longer assumes that
                        logical and actual line length are identical (which is
                        sometimes the case when using VESA drivers).

4.00	15.04.2021	- Made it possible to assemble with TASM 5.
			- Included necessary Borland tools.
			- Added 286 optimized BGI/BP7 drivers.
			-  Applied some speed and size optimizations:
			   BGIBENCH SVGA 5
			   SVGA 3.51A:   196.25     n/a  188.55
			   SVGA 4.00:    194.55  193.40  180.80
